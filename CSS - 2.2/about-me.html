            <p>
                <strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong> I had so many thing that I
                thought I loved, but the truth was I couldn't appreciate any of it
                because there was too much.
            </p>
            <p>
                Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want
                to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
            </p>
            <h3 class='about-me-subtitle'>How I turned things around</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>I was on the verge of breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong>
                I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved
                into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't
                know what else to do. And it worked.
            </p>
            <h3 class='about-me-subtitle'>Now I live a simple life</h3>
            <p>
                Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed,
                enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>
                With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but
                to start sharing how I did it,</strong> and how others can benefit from living
                a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
